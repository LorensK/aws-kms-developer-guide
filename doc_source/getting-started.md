# Managing keys<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with AWS KMS, create an [AWS KMS key](concepts.md#kms_keys)\. The topics in this section explain how to manage a symmetric KMS key from creation to deletion\. It includes topics on editing and viewing keys, tagging keys, enabling and disabling keys, rotating key material, and using AWS tools and services to monitor use of your KMS keys\. It also includes information about using AWS CloudFormation to create and manage your KMS keys and a [key state reference](key-state.md) that shows the required key state for each AWS KMS operation\.

For information about creating, using, and managing other types of KMS keys, including asymmetric keys, multi\-Region keys, keys with imported key material, and keys in custom key stores, see [Special\-purpose keys](key-types.md)\.
