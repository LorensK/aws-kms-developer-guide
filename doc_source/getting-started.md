# Getting started<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started, create an [AWS KMS key](concepts.md#kms_keys)\. The topics in this section explain how to create, view, edit, enable, disable, and tag your KMS key\. They also explain how to download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key\.

You can perform these AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) tasks in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\. You can access all AWS KMS features by using the [AWS KMS API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/)\. To run the AWS KMS API operations, use an [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk), [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/) or [AWS Tools for PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/)\.
