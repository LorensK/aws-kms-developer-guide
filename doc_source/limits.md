# Quotas<a name="limits"></a>

To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of quotas, resource quotas and request quotas\. Each quota is calculated independently for each Region of each AWS account\.

**Important**  
If you need to exceed a quota, you can request a quota increase in Service Quotas\. Use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) or the [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation\. For details, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. If Service Quotas for AWS KMS are not available in the AWS Region, please visit the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case\.   
To request an increase in an AWS KMS quota, see [Requesting an AWS KMS quota Increase](increase-quota.md)\.
