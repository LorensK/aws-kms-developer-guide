# Security best practices for AWS Key Management Service<a name="best-practices"></a>

AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) supports many security features that you can implement to enhance the protection of your encryption keys, including [key policies](key-policies.md) and [IAM policies](iam-policies.md), an [encryption context](concepts.md#encrypt_context) option for cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption keys, an extensive set of [condition keys](policy-conditions.md) to refine your key policies and IAM policies, and [grant constraints](grants.md#terms-grant-constraint) to limit grants\.

These security features are described in detail in [AWS Key Management Service Best Practices \(PDF\)](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-kms-best-practices.pdf)\. The general guidelines in this technical paper do not represent a complete security solution\. Because not all best practices are appropriate for all situations, these are not intended to be prescriptive\.
