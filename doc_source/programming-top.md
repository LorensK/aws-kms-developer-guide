# Programming the AWS KMS API<a name="programming-top"></a>

You can use the AWS KMS API to create and manage KMS keys and special features, such as [custom key stores](custom-key-store-overview.md), and use KMS keys in [cryptographic operations](concepts.md#cryptographic-operations)\. For detailed information, see the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference*\.

The sample code in the following topics show how to use the AWS SDKs to call the AWS KMS API\.

For information about using the AWS KMS console to perform some of these tasks, see [Managing keys](getting-started.md)\.
